JSX: JavaScript Syntax Extension acc. to official documentation of React.

Functions:
1. Purpose: perform computations, reusable logic
2. Returns any value (number, string, object, etc.)
3. Cannot manage internal state in React
4. Not reactive; cannot trigger re-renders
Components:
1. To render UI, manage state, handle lifecycle events
2. Returns JSX
3. Manage internal state using React Hooks (like useState)
4. Reactive; changes in state or props trigger UI re-renders

State: Can only be declared and used inside a component. To use in other components, we can pass it as props.
Variables: Can be declared and used outside a function/component e.g. global variables.

JS Expressions: code that directly returns a value. It can be written inside JSX.
Exmp#1:
<p>{2 + 3}</p>
Exmp#2:
let fname = "Usman"
let lname = "Shafiq"
<p>{fname+lname}</p>

JS statements: code that performs an action but doesn't directly return a value. It cannot be written inside JSX.
Exmp#1:
<p>{let fname = "Usman"}</p>
Exmp#2
<div>{for (let x of arr) {
    console.log(x);
}}</div>
